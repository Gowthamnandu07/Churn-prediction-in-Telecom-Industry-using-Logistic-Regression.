### What is Customer Churn?
When customers or subscribers end their business with a firm or service, it's referred to as customer churn. 

In the telecom industry, customers have various service providers to choose from and frequently switch between them. Due to this competition, the telecommunications industry has an annual churn rate of 15-25 %. However, personalized customer retention is difficult for most firms, as they have a large customer base and cannot devote much time to each individual. The costs of doing so would outweigh the additional revenue. Nonetheless, if a company could predict which customers were most likely to leave, they could focus their retention efforts on these "high risk" clients, ultimately expanding their coverage area and increasing customer loyalty. 


The key to succeeding in this market is the customer themselves. Customer churn is a crucial metric because it's more cost-effective to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones. To detect early signs of potential churn, firms must first develop a comprehensive understanding of their customers and their interactions across various channels. By addressing churn, businesses can not only preserve their market position but also grow and thrive. The more customers in their network, the lower the cost of initiation and the larger the profit. Therefore, the company's primary focus for success should be reducing client attrition and implementing effective retention strategies.


### Objectives:
 âž” Determining the percentage of customers who churn and those who continue to use active services.
 âž” Examining the information based on different attributes that contribute to the departure of customers.
 âž” Discovering the optimal machine learning model for accurately distinguishing between Churn and non-Churn customers.
 
 
 ### Dataset:
[Telco customer churnðŸ™‚](https://www.kaggle.com/bhartiprasad17/customer-churn-prediction/data)

## The data set includes information about:
âž” The column labeled Churn contains information about customers who have departed within the past month.

âž” Information regarding the demographics of customers, including their gender, age group, and whether they have partners or dependents.

âž” The services that every client has subscribed to include phone, various lines, internet, online security, online backup, device safeguarding, technical assistance, and      streaming of television shows and films.

âž” Details regarding customer accounts include their tenure as a customer, contract status, payment mode, preference for paperless billing, monthly expenses, and overall        charges.

### Implementation:
Libraries: sklearn, Matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, and NumPy
