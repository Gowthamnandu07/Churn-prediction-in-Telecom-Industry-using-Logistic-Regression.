### What is Customer Churn?
When customers or subscribers end their business with a firm or service, it's referred to as customer churn. 

In the telecom industry, customers have various service providers to choose from and frequently switch between them. Due to this competition, the telecommunications industry has an annual churn rate of 15-25 %. However, personalized customer retention is difficult for most firms, as they have a large customer base and cannot devote much time to each individual. The costs of doing so would outweigh the additional revenue. Nonetheless, if a company could predict which customers were most likely to leave, they could focus their retention efforts on these "high risk" clients, ultimately expanding their coverage area and increasing customer loyalty. 


The key to succeeding in this market is the customer themselves. Customer churn is a crucial metric because it's more cost-effective to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones. To detect early signs of potential churn, firms must first develop a comprehensive understanding of their customers and their interactions across various channels. By addressing churn, businesses can not only preserve their market position but also grow and thrive. The more customers in their network, the lower the cost of initiation and the larger the profit. Therefore, the company's primary focus for success should be reducing client attrition and implementing effective retention strategies.
